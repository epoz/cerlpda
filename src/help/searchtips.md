# Tips for searching

You can add an \* when searching for partial words, for example:
[manu\*](/search?q=manu*) will search for all words that start with _manu_.

You can also combine multiple words, then it searches for all words in the query.
[stans mensam](/search?q=stans+mensam) (a logical AND query)

If you want to do broader search combining multiple words, combine the words with "OR", like:
[stans OR evangelia](/search?q=stans+OR+evangelia) (a logical OR query)
